# ML-tutorials
This repository houses previous models I've constructed for various projects in one location. This is a functional version of various sklearn, keras, and tf models for supervised regression and classifications problems. Designed to be immediately usable, the only non-default formal parameter inputs to the functions are X,y which should be in the form of Pandas DataFrame and Pandas Series respectively( should also work for numpy array), where X contains the features as columns and y is a single target variable.

# Types of Models included
There are 4 main models developed in this repository: linear regression(ordinary least squares, lasso(l1 regularizer), and ridge(l2 regularizer)), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Adaboost Ensemble Method, and Artificial Neural Networks(ANN). These 4 models cover a wide breadth of the developed Machine Learning model frameworks and should provide robust results for properly cleaned datasets for supervised regression/classification.
