This repository houses previous models I've constructed for various projects in one location. This is a functional version of various sklearn, keras, and tf models for supervised regression and classifications problems. Designed to be immediately usable, the only non-default formal parameter inputs to the functions are X,y which should be in the form of Pandas DataFrame and Pandas Series respectively( should also work for numpy array), where X contains the features as columns and y is a single target variable.
