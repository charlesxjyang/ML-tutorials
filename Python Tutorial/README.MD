## Python Tutorials

This folder contains notebooks for learning data science workflows, techniques, and tools in Python. 
Although the notebooks are written in Python, they will not focus on developing syntax specific to Python or
general CS concepts.

### How to best use this resource

These notebooks are designed to be a starting point for someone who has a basic understanding of programming
but wants to learn specific skills in Python related to data science. Although these notebooks in no way cover the entire
array of tools you will need, they can point you to many resources that I've found invaluable over the years.
